OVO Multimedia uses libries (Java Native Access library, jna-3.55.2.jar, pdf-renderer and 
some java core libraries) which are written in pure java and other libraries too written in
c and c++ which are accessed through wrapper classes written in java( vlc core library vlcj-3.0.1.jar)

Libraries, and resources(images, sounds and icons) were packaged into a single exe file 
thus making it run only on window computers even if it was written in java
